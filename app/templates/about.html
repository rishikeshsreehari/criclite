    <h1>About CricLite</h1>
    <p>CricLite is a live cricket score website built out of frustration with the slow loading times and 
    complicated structure of modern cricket websites. In a world where cricket connects 2.5 billion fans, 
    why should checking scores be such a heavy experience?</p>
    <p>By design, CricLite is minimal and uses only plain ASCII for displaying information. The entire site is 
    approximately 10KB with no client-side JavaScript, loading almost instantly in any environment.</p>
    <h2>Terminal Access</h2>
    <p>Get live scores directly in your terminal:</p>
    <div class="terminal-cmd">Linux/Mac: <code>curl -s https://criclite.com/plain.txt</code></div>
    <div class="terminal-cmd">Windows: <code>curl.exe -s https://criclite.com/plain.txt</code></div>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>CricLite was inspired by the design of <a href="https://plaintextsports.com" target="_blank">plaintextsports.com</a> which unfortunately didn't cover cricket
    and wasn't open-source. Given the massive global cricket audience, creating a similar experience 
    for cricket fans seemed like an interesting experiment.</p>
    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>The site is built with FastAPI and hosted on an EC2 instance in AWS Mumbai servers. Content is 
    cached via CloudFront CDN with a TTL of 1 minute to ensure the EC2 instance doesn't face excessive
    load during traffic spikes. All data is sourced from CricAPI with scores updating every minute.</p>
    
    <p>No client-side JavaScript is used, including for the light/dark theme toggle. I do not collect any user data 
    except some analytics via GoatCounter, which is GDPR-friendly. The theme state is stored in your browser via cookies.</p>
    <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>CricLite is open source software. You can view the code and contribute on 
    <a href="https://github.com/rishikeshsreehari/criclite" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Features in the pipeline include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detailed scorecards</li>
        <li>Live commentary</li>
        <li>Match analysis</li>
        <li>Weather forecasts</li>
        <li>Win predictors</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Support</h2>
<p>Currently, CricLite costs $5.99 per month for API charges and is limited to updates every 1 minute. 
With your support, I can upgrade to a better API plan that would allow for 10-second polling and more 
real-time score updates. You can support the project on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/rishikeshs" target="_blank">Ko-fi</a>.</p>
